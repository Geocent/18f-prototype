## Description: 

Write a brief description, no greater than 750 words, of the approach used to create the working prototype and place this description in the README.md file located in the root directory of your repository.
Pool One Design: In addition to the Description, above, the Quoter must demonstrate that they followed the U.S. Digital Services Playbook by providing evidence in the repository. The README.md file should also make reference to the following for Pool One design:

## Pool One Design: 

In addition to the Description, above, the Quoter must demonstrate that they followed the U.S. Digital Services Playbook by providing evidence in the repository. The README.md file should also make reference to the following for Pool One design:

* a. assigned one leader and gave that person authority and responsibility and held that person accountable for the quality of the prototype submitted: 
  * Brian Priest is our Quality Lead
* b. assembled a multidisciplinary and collaborative team that includes at a minimum three of the labor categories limited to the Design Pool Labor categories to design the prototype as quoted in Attachment C. The quoter’s proposed mix of labor categories and level of effort for its working prototype, as reflected in Attachment C, shall be evaluated to assess the quoter’s understanding and capability to supply agile delivery services.
  * See Attachement C
* c. understand what people need, by including people (see note #1) in the prototype design process
* d. used at least three “human-centered design” techniques or tools
* e. created or used a design style guide and/or a pattern library
* f. used at least three modern (see Note#2) and open source frontend or client side (see note ￼￼#3) web technologies
* g. performed usability tests with people
* h. used an interactive approach, where feedback informed subsequent work or versions of the prototype
* i. created a prototype that works on multiple devices and presents a responsive design
* j. provided sufficient documentation to install and run their prototype on another machine
* k. prototype and underlying platforms used to create and run the prototype are openly licensed and free of charge.

## Pool Two Development Pool: 

In addition to the Description, above, the Quoter must demonstrate that they followed the U.S. Digital Services Playbook by providing evidence in the repository. The README.md file should also make reference to the following for Pool Two Development:

* a. assigned one leader, gave that person authority and responsibility and held that person accountable for the quality of the prototype submitted
  * Brian Priest is our Quality Lead
* b. assembled a multidisciplinary and collaborative team that includes at a minimum two of the labor categories limited to the Development Pool labor categories to develop the prototype as quoted in Attachment C. The quoter’s proposed mix of labor categories and level of effort for its working prototype, as reflected in Attachment C, shall be evaluated to assess the quoter’s understanding and capability to supply agile delivery services
  * See Attachement C
* c. used at least five modern and open-source technologies, regardless of architectural layer (frontend, backend etc)
* d. deployed the prototype on an Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) or Platform as a Service (PaaS) provider, and indicated which provider was used
* e. wrote unit tests for their code
* f. set up or used a continuous integration system to automate the running of tests and continuously deployed their code to their IaaS or PaaS provider
* g. set up or used configuration management
* h. set up or used continuous monitoring
* i. deploy their software in a container (i.e., utilized operating-system-level virtualization)
* j. used an interactive approach, where feedback informed subsequent work or versions of ￼￼the prototype
* k. provided sufficient documentation to install and run their prototype on another machine
* l. prototype and underlying platforms used to create and run the prototype are openly licensed and free of charge

## Pool Three The Full Stack Pool: 

In addition to the Description, above, the quoter must demonstrate that they followed the U.S. Digital Services Playbook by providing evidence in the repository. The README.md file should also make reference to the following for Pool Three Full Stack:

* a. met all the evidence criteria listed above in the Design Pool and Development Pool and Attachment C includes at a minimum five of the labor categories from the Full Stack Pool categories.
