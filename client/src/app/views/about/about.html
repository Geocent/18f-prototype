          <h1>About DrugIQ</h1>

          <p>
            Drug IQ is a web app created as a response to the ADS Prototype challenge.
            The ADS Prototype challenge leverages an OpenFDA API that helps users explore reported adverse drug events.
            An
            adverse event is submitted to the FDA to report any undesirable experience associated with the use of a
            drug,
            including serious drug side effects, product use errors, product quality problems, and therapeutic failures.
            <br/><br/>Reporting of adverse events by healthcare professionals and consumers is voluntary in the United
            States.
            Increases in the total number of adverse events are likely caused by improved reporting, news, enforcement 
            actions, and other phenomena can also spur reporting.          
          </p>
